    "A `FocusTraversalPolicy` is an abstract class that contains the logic for finding the next focusable widget within a `FocusTraversalGroup`.",
    "You create your own custom navigation rules by extending this class and overriding its methods, most importantly `sortDescendants`.",
    "The `sortDescendants` method gives you a list of all focusable nodes within the group. Your job is to sort this list into the desired traversal order.",
    "Once sorted, Flutter uses this list to automatically handle methods like `nextFocus`, `previousFocus`, `first` and `last`. You rarely need to override them directly.",
    "This is the core of creating custom navigation experiences for complex layouts like grids, where the default 'reading order' isn't sufficient."
